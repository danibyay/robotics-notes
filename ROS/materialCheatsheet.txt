    A standard URDF can specify colors using a tag such as in the RRBot:

    <material name="orange"/>

    With the color orange defined separately such as in the file materials.xacro:

    <material name="orange">
      <color rgba="${255/255} ${108/255} ${10/255} 1.0"/>
    </material>

    Unfortunately, this method of specifying link colors does not work in Gazebo as it adopts OGRE's material scripts for coloring and texturing links. Instead, a Gazebo material tag must be specified for each link, such as:

    <gazebo reference="link1">
      <material>Gazebo/Orange</material>
    </gazebo>

These <gazebo reference=...> tags allow to embed native SDF commands for model links into URDF.

So, you should include in your URDF something like:

<gazebo reference="base_link">
  <material>Gazebo/Yellow</material>
</gazebo>
