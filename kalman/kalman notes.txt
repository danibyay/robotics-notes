    The Kalman Filter cannot be used when the measurement and/or state transition functions are nonlinear, since this would result in a non-Gaussian distribution.

    Instead, we take a local linear approximation and use this approximation to update the covariance of the estimate. The linear approximation is made using the first terms of the Taylor Series, which includes the first derivative of the function.

    In the multi-dimensional case, taking the first derivative isn't as easy as there are multiple state variables and multiple dimensions. Here we employ a Jacobian, which is a matrix of partial derivatives, containing the partial derivative of each dimension with respect to each state variable.
